# This is a basic program to demonstrate using modules from the standard library.
# It pushes two u64 numbers onto the stack and then checks which is bigger.
# The numbers are placed on the stack by first pushing the low limb, then the high limb.

# Import the u64 math module from the standard library.
use.std::math::u64

begin
  # push the low limb then the high limb. b = 4294967296
  push.2.5
  # push the low limb then the high limb. a = 4294967299
  push.3.1

  # 5.2 is bigger than 1.3
  exec.u64::max

  # truncate stack to end with less than 16 elements
  swapw dropw
